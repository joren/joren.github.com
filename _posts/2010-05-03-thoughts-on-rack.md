At the most recent [ArrrrCamp](http://arrrrcamp.be) I gave a small introduction to [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/) and Rack Middlewares in a Ruby on Rails application.

It was really interesting because I had some people in the room who knew a lot more than me about Rack and some of them who had never played with it. So we had some nice small discussions about when we use some middlewares like [RACK::GOOGLE-ANALYTICS](http://github.com/leehambley/rack-google-analytics) and [Device](http://github.com/plataformatec/devise).
I had the feeling that in the end we had convinced a lot of people of starting to play with Rack, so my mission was accomplished.

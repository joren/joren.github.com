<p>Our client was the resident internet marketing expert for a large internet based service. She was British and prided herself on a certain acuity that we in the States could obviously never aspire too.</p>

<p>One of her favorite things to point out was the chunky, unprofessional compression of our images. This went on for months. One day, we showed her designs for a microsite, lovingly rendered. And that complaint came back yet again. Finally, I asked her to go to her monitor settings. She did. “Is your monitor set to thousands of colors by any chance?” It was. My god. How many hours of our lives had we lost addressing her literally nonexistent issue?</p>

<p>Needless to say, once the Internet Expert changed her settings to the standard Millions of Colors, the quality of our comps jumped in her most considered estimation.</p>

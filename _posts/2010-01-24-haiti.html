<p>Meet Kiki, Boy Wonder, alive and well after eight days under the rubble of earthquake-blitzed Port au Prince.<br/><br/>Kiki was saved after an incredible operation, in the Nazan district of the Haitan capital, mounted by US earthquake experts.<br/><br/>The heroes and heroines were members of urban rescue squads from New York and Virginia, some of whom had been involved in the 9/11 horrors of New York in 2001.</p>

<p>The photographs you are about to see show how a very determined male bird tries to save his female mate that has been seriously injured.<br/> Here the female bird is injured and her condition is not good.<br/> The male bird brings her food and attends to her with love and compassion.<br/> Although he tries to help her, she is too badly injured and dies.<br/> He is shocked over her death and tries desperately to bring her back to life, trying to pull her up and make her move.<br/> He finally realizes that his sweetheart has passed away and will never come back to him, and brokenhearted - he cries over his lost love.<br/> He stands by her side, calling and crying for help. He is devastated by her death.<br/> Finally realizing that she will never return to him, he stands beside her lifeless body with great sadness and sorrow, unable to leave her side.<br/> The photos of these two birds are said to have been taken in the Republic of the Ukraine. This male bird was bound and determined to save his female mate. The photographer sold these pictures for a small price to one of the most famous newspapers in France. All the copies of that newspaper were sold out on the day they published these photos.</p>

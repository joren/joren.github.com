<p><br/><strong><a href="http://www.sandermulder.com/continue_time.html">Continue Time</a></strong> is a concept clock by <a href="http://www.sandermulder.com">Sander Mulder</a>, where each of the three clock hands are connected end-to-end and rotate around each other (for example, the top photo shows the clock at 1:43:03, the lower photo at 3:38:30).</p>

<p>To see this idea in motion, <a href="http://www.handinhandclock.com/">Hand in Hand Clock</a> is a similar concept by Stockholm designer <a href="http://www.johanbissemattsson.se/">Johan Bisse Mattsson</a>, who offers his work in digital/screensaver form.</p>

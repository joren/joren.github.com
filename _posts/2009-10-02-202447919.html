<p><b>Destined For Microfame of the Day:</b> This sharp-dressed time-traveller was seen ambling in the vicinity of the site where a Cornell University student <a href="http://absinthetic.livejournal.com/843495.html">met an untimely demise</a>.</p>

<p>Is this “Disaster Guy”?</p>

<p>Ha, “fell into a gorge?” That may possibly be the case. Then again, Cornell is famous for its gorge-jumping suicides.</p>

<p>As for the British Detective in America… well… maybe bowler hats are back!</p>

<p>Wow, it’s amazing how an Internet meme that I created over six years ago is still active and circulating now. And almost three years after <a href="http://eastvillageidiot.com/2006/11/30/get-the-picture/">I revived it on my blog</a>.</p>

<p>The real story: this was a Cornell University Hotel School staffer who came to the rescue of a student who “fell” into Cascadilla Gorge on November 8, 2002. The student survived, and this photo was on the front page of the Ithaca Journal a day later. I created a series of photoshopped pictures based off this photo <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021217021029/http://www.ithaca.edu/students/coleary1/scary.htm">on my student web site</a>, which still exist on a dusty hard drive somewhere in my parents’ basement.</p>

<p>What’s funny is I was just talking about this very picture on Valentines Day with <a href="http://caro.tumblr.com">caro</a>, et al. And a week and change later, it resurfaces on teh interwebs.</p>

<p>SHUT THE FUCK UP! That’s the dude in charge of IT at the Hotel School. Awesome. He deserves to be famous.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Wow, I remember that happening - I was a sophomore at the time and would walk past Cascadilla on the way to class every day.</p>
